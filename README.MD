<h1 align="center">Virtual MouseðŸ§ª</h1>

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello
This project creates a virtual mouse using Python, leveraging OpenCV for image capture and processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and PyAutoGUI for mouse control. It detects hand movements via a webcam, specifically focusing on the index finger for moving the cursor and the distance between the index finger and thumb to simulate mouse clicks. The program maps the hand's position within the video frame to the screen's dimensions to accurately control the cursor. This allows users to interact with their computer using hand gestures, offering an innovative and hands-free way to navigate and click, enhancing accessibility and providing a novel approach to human-computer interaction.
